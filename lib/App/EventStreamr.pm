# ABSTRACT: Conference Mixing/Streaming Orchestrator

# VERSION: Generated by DZP::OurPkg:Version

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use App::EventStreamr;

  my $eventstreamr = App::EventStreamr->new();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bourne due to the instability of DVswitch, EventStreamr attempts to 
remove the time consuming process that is connecting up all the 
devices and ensuring they stay connected.

First you should configure the system, although if using in 
conjuction with the frontend it will provide a number of useful
defaults.

  eventstreamr --configure

Once configured you can add 'eventstreamr' as a startup process
or launch from the cli.

  eventstreamr

=cut

use App::EventStreamr::Config;

has 'config' => (
  is => 'rw',
  isa => sub { "App::EventStreamr::Config" },
  lazy => 1,
  builder => 1,
  handles => [ qw( configure write_config ) ],
);

method _build_config() {
  return App::EventStreamr::Config->new();
}

use App::EventStreamr::Status;

has 'status' => (
  is => 'rw',
  isa => sub { "App::EventStreamr::Status" },
  lazy => 1,
  builder => 1,
  handles => [ qw( starting stopping restarting set_state threshold post_status ) ],
);

method start() {

}

method run() {
  print "Run Loop!\n";
  sleep 10;
}

method stop() {

}
